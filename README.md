A `static desktop application` built using `C#`, designed for managing pharmacy operations. It features
multiple modules to handle various aspects of pharmacy management, including Employees
management, billing, medicine tracking, and Companies records.

- File Handling for saving and retrieving data using `.txt` files.

### ðŸ“‚ Features:

*`1. Agent Management`*
- Add, search, edit, and manage agent details with ease.
- Maintain comprehensive records to streamline operations.

*`2. Billing Module`*
- Record customer transactions accurately.
- Generate detailed bills for enhanced financial tracking.

*`3. Medicine Inventory Management`*
- Track available stock and manage inventory efficiently.
- Monitor medicine details, including batch, expiry, and pricing.

*`4. Manufacturer Management`*
- Maintain detailed records of manufacturers.
- Simplify tracking and communication with suppliers.
 
âš  Current Status:
- This project is currently functional but relies on a database. The UI is responsive and designed primarily for desktop usage.

## ðŸ”‘ Login Information:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123`

âš  Important Notice:
If any attempt is made to change the username or password in the code, a warning message will appear.
This helps ensure system security by preventing unauthorized modifications to login credentials.
Below is an example of how the warning message is implemented:
```
 //for save data in your file
   string filename = @"E:\Project_OOP\FO_organization\Pharmacy-Management\savedLogin.txt";   // Ø§Ø³ØªØ®Ø¯Ø§Ù… using Ù„Ø¶Ù…Ø§Ù† Ø¥ØºÙ„Ø§Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØ§Ø±Ø¯ ØªÙ„Ù‚Ø§Ø¦ÙŠÙ‹Ø§
  using (FileStream myfile = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write))
 {
   using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(myfile))
   {
      sw.WriteLine($"username: {username.Text}\t password:{password.Text}");
   }
}
 //MessageBox.Show("Your data has been saved");
 if (name == "admin" && pass == "123")
 {
     Hide();
     Home basic = new Home();
     basic.ShowDialog();
 }
 else
 {
    MessageBox.Show("Error,your Username or Password is incorrect");
    username.Text = password.Text = null;
 }
}
  
```

ðŸ’¡ How to Disable the Warning Message:
To disable the warning message or modify the login credentials, you can update them directly in the code. Below is where the username and password are hardcoded:
```
// Example of where login credentials are set
string username = "admin";
string password = "123";
```
If you need to change the credentials, simply update the `username` and `password` variables in the code.
Make sure to test the program after making changes to ensure proper functionality.
