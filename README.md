A `static desktop application` built using `C#`, designed for managing pharmacy operations. It features
multiple modules to handle various aspects of pharmacy management, including agent
management, billing, medicine tracking, and manufacturer records.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

- `C# (Windows Forms)` for building the user interface and implementing the business logic.
- File Handling for saving and retrieving data using `.txt` files.

### ðŸ“‚ Features:

- Agent Management: Add, search, edit, and manage agent details.
- Billing Module: Record transactions and generate bills for customers.
- Medicine Tracking: Manage medicine inventory and track available stock.
- Manufacturer Records: Store and manage manufacturer details efficiently.
 
âš  Current Status:
This project is currently functional but relies on file handling instead of a database. The UI is non-responsive and designed primarily for desktop usage.

---
## ðŸ”‘ Login Information:

- Username: `omar`
- Password: `123`

âš  Important Notice:
If any attempt is made to change the username or password in the code, a warning message will appear.
This helps ensure system security by preventing unauthorized modifications to login credentials.
Below is an example of how the warning message is implemented:
```
  //for save data in your file
  string filename = @"D:\Project_OOP\FO_organization\project_fo_3\project_fo_3\Login.txt";
  FileStream myfile = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);

  StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(myfile);
  sw.WriteLine($"username: {username.Text}\t password:{password.Text}");
  sw.Flush();
  MessageBox.Show("Your data has been saved");


  if (name == "omar" && pass == "123")
      {
          MessageBox.Show("hi,poss");
          Hide();
          Home basic = new Home();
          basic.ShowDialog();
      }
      else
      {
          MessageBox.Show("Error,your Username or Password is incorrect");
          username.Text = password.Text = null;
      }

  }
```
ðŸ’¡ How to Disable the Warning Message:
To disable the warning message or modify the login credentials, you can update them directly in the code. Below is where the username and password are hardcoded:
```
// Example of where login credentials are set
string username = "omar";
string password = "123";
```
If you need to change the credentials, simply update the `username` and `password` variables in the code.
Make sure to test the program after making changes to ensure proper functionality.

## ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements:

- `Database` Integration (e.g., SQL Server) for more reliable and scalable data management.
- User Authentication System for `secure` access to the application.
- Responsive UI with potential dark mode support for improved user experience.
- This project demonstrates how C# Windows Forms can be used for building structured and efficient pharmacy management systems, with easy data handling and modular design.
